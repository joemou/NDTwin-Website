**NDTwin (Network Digital Twin)** is a high-fidelity emulation platform designed specifically for **OpenFlow-based SDN networks**. It bridges the gap between control plane logic and data plane reality.

Debugging in traditional OpenFlow workflows is notoriously difficult. Developers often struggle to visualize how flow entries installed by the controller actually affect packet forwarding in real-time. Parsing `ovs-ofctl dump-flows` text outputs is slow and error-prone.

**NDTwin solves this "visibility gap."** By integrating a high-performance C++ core with the Ryu Controller and sFlow telemetry, we provide a visualized environment where you can verify routing logic, monitor link bandwidth, and simulate failures instantly.

## What is NDTwin?

NDTwin operates as a comprehensive development ecosystem that synchronizes your physical or emulated network state with a digital graph model.

* **Topology Awareness**: The system continuously polls the Ryu controller to build a real-time graph of switches and links.
* **Traffic Intelligence**: A built-in sFlow collector listens for telemetry data to calculate bandwidth utilization and identify traffic patterns (like Elephant Flows) with high precision.
* **Deployment Flexibility**: Whether you are running a simulation in **Mininet** or deploying on a physical **Testbed** with hardware switches, NDTwin adapts its monitoring strategy accordingly.

## Why Choose NDTwin?

If your team is developing advanced network applications such as dynamic routing, load balancing, or energy-aware traffic engineering, NDTwin offers distinct advantages over standard monitoring tools.

### Key Benefits

* **Native OpenFlow Support**: Fully compatible with OpenFlow 1.0/1.3 standards. It seamlessly integrates with standard SDN controllers like **Ryu** or ONOS.
* **Real-time Flow Visualization**: Eliminate manual CLI debugging. Our graphical interface displays active Flow Rules and packet match counters, mapped directly to the topology.
* **Precise Traffic Monitoring**: Unlike simple counters, our integrated sFlow technology performs **5-tuple sampling** (Src/Dst IP, Port, Protocol) to analyze real-time bandwidth usage and detect congestion bottlenecks.
* **Dynamic Topology Awareness**: The system automatically detects Link Failures or new switch connections, triggering alerts to help you verify if your rerouting algorithms react correctly.

## Use Cases

| Scenario | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Algorithm Verification** | Validate if your new shortest-path or multipath routing algorithms work as expected under load. |
| **Network Education** | Help students visualize the abstract concept of the "Match-Action" mechanism in OpenFlow. |
| **Energy-Saving Research** | Simulate network behavior when specific switch ports are powered down to save energy, and verify connectivity is maintained. |
