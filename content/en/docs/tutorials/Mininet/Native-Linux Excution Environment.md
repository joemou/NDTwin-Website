# Native-Linux Execution Environment Setup

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to manually build the Network Digital Twin (NDT) environment on a native Linux machine. 

## 1. System Requirements

The system has been verified on the following configuration:

* **OS:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or higher (Verified on Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS).
* **Kernel:** Generic Linux Kernel (x86_64).
* **Permissions:** Root access (`sudo`) is required for Mininet and Open vSwitch operations.

---

## 2. System Dependencies Installation

You need to install build tools, network analysis utilities, and specific C++ libraries required by the NDT Core and Mininet.



### Step 2.1: Update & Install Build Tools

We use `ninja-build` for faster compilation and `iperf3`/`wireshark` for traffic generation and analysis.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential cmake g++ make git \
    ninja-build xterm curl wireshark iperf3

```

### Step 2.2: Install Required Libraries & Mininet

Run the following command to install all necessary development libraries and the network emulator:

```bash
sudo apt install -y \
    libboost-all-dev \
    libfmt-dev \
    libspdlog-dev \
    libssh-dev \
    nlohmann-json3-dev \
    mininet \
    openvswitch-switch

```

### Step 2.3: Verify Network Components

Ensure Mininet and Open vSwitch (OVS) are installed correctly.

```bash
# Check OVS version
ovs-vsctl --version

# Test Mininet installation (Pingall test)
sudo mn --test pingall

```

---

## 3. Python Environment Setup (Conda)

The system requires two specific Python environments to handle version conflicts. **Ryu requires Python 3.8** due to specific library dependencies, while other components may use newer versions.

**Prerequisite:** Ensure [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/) or Anaconda is installed.

### Step 3.1: Create Ryu Environment (`ryu-env`)

This environment runs the SDN Controller.

1. **Create and Activate:**
```bash
conda create -n ryu-env python=3.8 -y
conda activate ryu-env

```


2. **Install Packages:**
We must downgrade `setuptools` and pin `eventlet` to avoid compatibility errors in Ryu.
```bash
pip install "setuptools<59"
pip install "eventlet==0.30.2"
pip install ryu==4.34 networkx==3.1 ovs==3.6.1 requests==2.32.4 loguru==0.7.3

```


* *Note: If you encounter SSL issues, you may need to disable the SSLv3 minimum version check in your Python configuration.*


3. **Verify Ryu:**
```bash
ryu-manager --version

```



### Step 3.2: Create TE Environment (`te-env`)

This environment runs the Traffic Engineering application using modern Python features.

```bash
conda create -n te-env python=3.12 -y
conda activate te-env
pip install networkx==3.6.1 requests==2.32.5 loguru==0.7.3

```

---

## 4. Download & Compile NDT Core

We use CMake and Ninja to compile the C++ core.

### Step 4.1: Download Source Code

If you haven't downloaded the project yet, clone it to your Desktop (or preferred location).

```bash
cd ~/Desktop
git clone [https://github.com/NDTwin/NetworkDigitalTwin.git](https://github.com/NDTwin/NetworkDigitalTwin.git) NetworkDigitalTwin-main

```

### Step 4.2: Compile with Ninja

1. **Navigate to the project directory:**
```bash
cd ~/Desktop/NetworkDigitalTwin-main

```


2. **Prepare the build directory:**
```bash
rm -rf build  # Remove existing build directory if present
mkdir build && cd build

```


3. **Compile:**
*Note: We do not set the build type to "Release" yet as optimization flags are pending refactoring.*
```bash
cmake -GNinja ..
ninja clean && ninja

```



---

## 5. Prepare Network Topology Script

We rely on a custom Python script (`testbed_topo.py`) to solve **sFlow routing challenges**. This script creates a virtual management network on the loopback interface, allowing the host to receive sFlow packets from Mininet switches without disrupting internet connectivity.

**Action:** Create a file named `testbed_topo.py` in your `NetworkDigitalTwin-main` directory and paste the following code:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

"""
==========================================================================================
Mininet Topology Template for Stable sFlow Monitoring with Host Internet Coexistence
==========================================================================================
This script creates a Mininet network topology and configures sFlow monitoring
for each switch. It is meticulously designed to solve a common, complex problem:
how to send identifiable sFlow data from each switch to a local collector (like sflow-tool)
without disrupting the host machine's internet connection.

The Core Challenge:
-----------------------------
1.  Source IP: sFlow packets need a unique source IP to be identifiable (e.g., s1 -> 192.168.123.11).
2.  Destination IP: The collector (e.g., sflow-tool) often listens on localhost (127.0.0.1).
3.  The Conflict: Sending a packet from 192.168.123.11 to 127.0.0.1 is a cross-subnet routing problem.
4.  The Trap: Using IPs from the 127.0.0.0/8 range for switches will break the host's DNS and network.

The "IP Alias" Solution:
-------------------------------------------
This script elegantly solves the problem by creating a virtual "management network" within
the host machine's loopback interface.

1.  A dedicated private subnet (e.g., 192.168.123.0/24) is chosen for sFlow management.
2.  Each switch is assigned a unique IP from this subnet (e.g., s1 gets 192.168.123.11).
3.  A special IP Alias (e.g., 192.168.123.1) is added to the host's loopback ('lo') interface.
4.  Switches send sFlow packets to this IP Alias. Since the destination is on the 'lo' interface,
    the Linux kernel routes the packets internally directly to the collector, without any conflicts.

This ensures all three goals are met: Host network is safe, sFlow is delivered, and the source is identifiable.

----------------------------------------
A Note from the Developer:
----------------------------------------
If you're wondering how we cracked this tricky sFlow problem without breaking everything,
you're not alone! This elegant "IP Alias" solution was the result of a long and insightful
troubleshooting session with Google's Gemini. It's a great example of how AI can be a
powerful partner in research and development. Big thanks to our digital lab assistant!

## 6. Execution Workflow

**Pre-flight Checks:**

1. **Source Code:** Ensure `NetworkDigitalTwin-main` is in your `~/Desktop` (or adjust paths below).
2. **Compilation:** Ensure `ndt_main` exists in `build/bin/` (from Section 4).
3. **Topology Script:** Ensure `testbed_topo.py` exists (from Section 5).

**Startup Order is Critical:** Please execute Terminals 1 through 3 in the **exact order** listed below.

### Terminal 1: Ryu Controller

* **Purpose:** Starts the SDN Logic.
* **Environment:** `ryu-env` (Python 3.8).

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/NetworkDigitalTwin-main
conda activate ryu-env
# 'intelligent_router.py' is our custom controller app
ryu-manager intelligent_router.py ryu.app.rest_topology ryu.app.ofctl_rest --ofp-tcp-listen-port 6633 --observe-link

```

### Terminal 2: Mininet Topology

* **Purpose:** Creates the virtual network and configures sFlow.
* **Environment:** System Native (Root).

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/NetworkDigitalTwin-main
# Clean up old network artifacts (Crucial step)
sudo mn -c
# Start the custom topology script
sudo python3 testbed_topo.py

```

### Terminal 3: NDT Core

* **Purpose:** Starts the Digital Twin Engine.
* **Environment:** System Native (Root).

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/NetworkDigitalTwin-main/build

# Set API Key
# If you do not have a valid OpenAI API key, you can input any random string 
# (e.g., "12345") to bypass the check. The system will run, but LLM features will be disabled.
export OPENAI_API_KEY="any-random-string-here"

# Execute with sudo, preserving the environment variable (-E)
sudo -E bin/ndt_main --loglevel info

```

---

## 7. Generating Traffic (Validation)

To test if the system is working, you can generate traffic inside the **Mininet CLI** (Terminal 2).

1. **Start an iperf3 server on Host 1:**
```bash
mininet> h1 iperf3 -s &

```


2. **Run a client on Host 2:**
```bash
mininet> h2 iperf3 -c h1

```


3. **Observe:**
* **Terminal 1 (Ryu):** Should show link discovery logs.
* **Terminal 3 (NDT):** Logs should reflect flow detection and bandwidth usage.



---

## 8. Safe Shutdown Procedure

When finishing your experiment, please close the system in **reverse order** and perform cleanup to avoid errors in future runs:

1. In **Terminal 2 (Mininet)**, type `exit` to quit the CLI.
2. The script will automatically remove the IP alias.
3. Run a final cleanup command in Terminal 2:
```bash
sudo mn -c

```


4. Close all other terminal windows.
