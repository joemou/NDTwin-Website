Here is the complete **Installation & Setup Handbook** in English. You can save this as `README.md` or `INSTALL.md` in your project root to help other developers set up the environment correctly.

# NDTwin / SDN Monitor Project - Setup Guide

This guide details the installation of system dependencies, C++ libraries, and the specific Python environment required to build and run the SDN Monitoring modules (`FlowLinkUsageCollector`, `TopologyAndFlowMonitor`).

## ⚠️ Critical Requirement: Python Version

**You must use Python 3.8.**

This project relies on the **Ryu SDN Controller**, which depends on the `eventlet` library.

* **Do NOT use Python 3.10 or newer.**
* Newer Python versions (3.10+) removed `collections.Iterable`, causing Ryu to crash immediately with `AttributeError`.

---

## 1. System Requirements

* **OS:** Linux (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or 22.04 LTS recommended).
* **Compiler:** GCC or Clang with **C++17** support (required for `std::filesystem`, `std::shared_mutex`).
* **Privileges:** `sudo` access is required to install packages and interact with Open vSwitch (OVS).

## 2. Install C++ Build Dependencies

Install the necessary compilers and development libraries used in the C++ source code (Boost Graph Library, SPDLog, JSON, OpenSSL).

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential cmake

# 1. Boost C++ Libraries (Used for Graph structures)
sudo apt install -y libboost-all-dev

# 2. SPDLog (High-performance logging)
sudo apt install -y libspdlog-dev

# 3. nlohmann/json (JSON parsing for REST API)
sudo apt install -y nlohmann-json3-dev

# 4. OpenSSL (Used for SHA256 hashing)
sudo apt install -y libssl-dev

# 5. Curl (CLI tool used by the C++ code to fetch topology)
sudo apt install -y curl

```

---

## 3. Install Runtime Dependencies (SDN Tools)

The C++ code interacts directly with system-level network tools via shell commands (e.g., `popen("sudo ovs-vsctl ...")`).

```bash
# 1. Open vSwitch (OVS)
# Required for "ovs-vsctl" commands to map interfaces to ports.
sudo apt install -y openvswitch-switch

# Ensure the OVS service is running
sudo service openvswitch-switch start

# 2. Mininet (Optional/Mode Dependent)
# Required if running in utils::MININET mode.
sudo apt install -y mininet

```

---

## 4. Python Environment Setup (Ryu Controller)

As stated above, **Python 3.8 is mandatory**. We recommend using `Conda` or `venv` to isolate the environment.

### Option A: Using Conda (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Create a Python 3.8 environment
conda create -n sdn_env python=3.8 -y

# 2. Activate the environment
conda activate sdn_env

# 3. Install Python dependencies (Ryu, etc.)
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

### Option B: Using venv (Standard)

```bash
# 1. Install Python 3.8 (if not already on your system)
sudo apt install -y python3.8 python3.8-venv

# 2. Create the virtual environment
python3.8 -m venv venv

# 3. Activate the environment
source venv/bin/activate

# 4. Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## 5. Build & Run Instructions

### Building the C++ Project

Assuming a standard CMake project structure:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)

```



### Troubleshooting

**Issue:** `AttributeError: module 'collections' has no attribute 'Iterable'` when starting Ryu.

* **Cause:** You are running Python 3.10+.
* **Fix:** Switch to the Python 3.8 environment created in Step 4.

**Issue:** `popen() failed` or `Permission denied` in logs.

* **Cause:** The application was run without `sudo`, or the user does not have permission to run `ovs-vsctl`.
* **Fix:** Run the application with `sudo`.
